# Simple static sever file

The goal with this project is to just have a simple, stand alone, drop in static sever script to just host various static projects over http rather than the file protocol. I have wrote a [blog post in which I write about this kind of simple static sever script](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2017/12/04/nodejs-simple-static-sever-file/) in detail.

When it comes to using express there is a [built in static sever](https://dustinpfister.github.io//2018/05/24/express-static/) that can be used to make quick work of this sort of thing also, and there is also the official [serve index middle ware for express](https://dustinpfister.github.io//2021/03/22/express-example-serve-index/) that works great. Although these solutions work great, they both require that I use express as part of the static for a nodejs project. Not such a bad thing as express is a great framework, but in the event that I want to do something from the ground up I will want some kind of vanilla javaScript solution for this sort of thing. That is where these scripts come into play.
